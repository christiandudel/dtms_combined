# dtms_combined

The folder “Combined” includes two files. The file all.R is (almost) all
code from the R package dtms (<https://github.com/christiandudel/dtms>).
Sourcing it should provide a lot of the functionality of the package;
dependencies are still required, though. The file selected.R only
includes a subset of the functions and removes most of the
documentation, but is much smaller than all.R. Again dependencies might
be required.

The folder “R” contains a single file of code to generate the two files
in “Combined”.
